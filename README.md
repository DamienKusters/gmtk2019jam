# GMTK 2019 GameJam - Analyzation
# Concept
The game will be called: "Only One Love"
# Description
This game will feature one big plaza where a bunch of people are passing by.
One person will be your "true love" and it's your job to find this person, take him/her on a date and confess your love to this person if your interests match.
To find this person you need to start conversations on the plaza and ask people about their interests.
Every person (including the player) will have their own set of "interests".
This could be their hobby, job, favorite food/item etc.
Only One person will have matching interests with the player, this is randomly decided.
# Conversations
You can walk up to strangers and start conversations.
Because you don't know this person, you will only be able to ask a limited amount of questions (or a single question). If you think, based upon their answers, you might have matching interests together, you could ask the person out.
As you meet a new person, you have to greet them first.
# Dating
To ask a person out for a date, you need to provide them with their favorite gift. This could range from like a bouquet, chocolate, jewelry, clothing, ticket to a stage play etc. The favorite gift is displayed in the 'conversation window'.
While you are dating you have the opportunity to ask more questions about this person.
Dates will be held at a restaurant. Asking questions will be the same as talking to strangers.
# Shops
Gifts can be purchased from shops located near the plaza. Each shop can sell Only One item (the item is based upon the type of the building (Florist=bouquet,Theatre=Ticket etc.)). You, as the player, can only buy One item each day, on top of that you can only hold One item at a time. So you only buy gifts if you're quite sure the person you are talking to could be your 'true love'.
The game will progress over a few days. Each day is a new attempt to date someone.
# Story
The player will be introduced to the game by the main character's best friend. He/she will be used to tutor the player on how to play the game. This character will also be a major story element as you can ask this person out on certain points in the game.
Successfully confessing your love to this person will result in the 'best ending'.
